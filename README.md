# NNQuST
Neural Network Quantum State Tomography.  Developed at PIQuIL

## Below, we'll keep track of our todo lists etc. (Let's do this on "Projects" if this readme gets messy)

1. Reproduce the results of the PSI tutorial on the Bolzmann machines.  (See lecture 10-14)
- Stick to a 4x4 lattice?  (Giacomo can advise)
- Let's figure out what to do with the data, so that we don't plug up this repository with it...

2. Decide on a language for the codebase: TensorFlow versus PyTorch (See "Projects").  
- Do we want to re-write the tutorial codes; once in TensorFlow and once in PyTorch, and decide?
- We could race the two implementations on the GPU.
- Do we want to build the code from scratch or use a package for the RBM?
