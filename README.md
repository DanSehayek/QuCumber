# NNQuST
Neural Network Quantum State Tomography.  Developed at PIQuIL

## Below, we'll keep track of our todo lists for the project

1. Reproduce the results of the PSI tutorial on the Bolzmann machines.  (See lecture 10-14)
- Stick to a 4x4 lattice?  (Giacomo can advise)
- Let's 

2. Decide on a language for the codebase: TensorFlow versus PyTorch.  
- Do we want to re-write the tutorial codes; once in TensorFlow and once in PyTorch, and decide?
- We could race the two implementations on the GPU.
