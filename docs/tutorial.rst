Once you have installed QuCumber, we recommend going through our tutorial that is divided into two parts.

#. Training an RBM to reconstruct a positive-real wavefunction (i.e. no phase) from a transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with ten sites and then generating new data.
#. Training an RBM to reconstruct a complex wavefunction (i.e. with a phase) from a simple two qubit state and then generating new data.

We have made interactive python notebooks that can be downloaded (along with the data required) here:

#. :download:`Positive-real wavefunction </examples/01_ising/01_ising.zip>`.
#. :download:`Complex wavefunction </examples/02_qubits/02_qubits.zip>`.

If you wish to simply view the static, non-interactive notebooks, continue to the next page of the documentation.
