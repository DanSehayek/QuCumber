Once you have installed QuCumber, we recommend going through our tutorial that
is divided into two parts.

#. Training a Wavefunction to reconstruct a positive-real wavefunction (i.e.
   no phase) from a transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and then generating new
   data.

#. Training an Wavefunction to reconstruct a complex wavefunction (i.e. with a
   phase) from a simple two qubit random state and then generating new data.

We have made interactive python notebooks that can be downloaded (along with
the data required) `here`__. Note that the linked examples are from the most
recent stable release (relative to the version of the docs you're currently
viewing), and may not match the examples shown in the following pages.
It is recommended that you refer to documentation for the latest stable
release: https://qucumber.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.

__ Release_

If you wish to simply view the static, non-interactive notebooks, continue to
the next page of the documentation.

Alternatively, you can view interactive notebooks online at: |BinderBadge|_,
though they may be slow.
