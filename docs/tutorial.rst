Once you have installed QuCumber, we recommend going through our tutorial that
is divided into two parts.

#. Training a Wavefunction to reconstruct a positive-real wavefunction (i.e.
   no phase) from a transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and then generating new
   data.

#. Training an Wavefunction to reconstruct a complex wavefunction (i.e. with a
   phase) from a simple two qubit random state and then generating new data.

We have made interactive python notebooks that can be downloaded (along with
the data required) here:

https://github.com/PIQuIL/QuCumber/releases

If you wish to simply view the static, non-interactive notebooks, continue to
the next page of the documentation.

Alternatively, you can view interactive notebooks online at: |BinderBadge|_,
though they may be slow.
