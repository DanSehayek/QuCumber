Once you have installed QuCumber, we recommend going through our tutorial that
is divided into two parts.

#. Training a Wavefunction to reconstruct a positive-real wavefunction (i.e.
   no phase) from a transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and then generating new
   data.

#. Training an Wavefunction to reconstruct a complex wavefunction (i.e. with a
   phase) from a simple two qubit random state and then generating new data.

We have made interactive python notebooks that can be downloaded (along with
the data required) here:

You can also view interactive notebooks online at: :image: _static/binder_badge.png :target: |binder_url|

If you wish to simply view the static, non-interactive notebooks, continue to
the next page of the documentation.
